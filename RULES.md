# Read-a-Thon Application Rules

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29

This file contains universal rules that apply across all pages and features in the Read-a-Thon application. These rules MUST be followed for every implementation.

---

## Data Source Rules (ALWAYS TRUE)

### Primary Data Sources
- **Classes/Students:** `Roster` table (columns: `student_name`, `teacher_name`, `grade_level`, `team_name`, `class_name`)
- **Reading Minutes:** `Daily_Logs` table (capped at 120 minutes/day, includes color bonus)
- **Participation:** `Daily_Logs` table (students with >0 minutes for a given day)
- **Goals Met:** `Daily_Logs` table (students who met â‰¥1 day reading goal)
- **Fundraising/Sponsors:** `Reader_Cumulative` table (aggregated totals per student)
- **Team Assignments:** `Roster.team_name` column

### Data Calculation Rules
- **Minutes are ALWAYS capped at 120/day** for contest calculations
- **Color war bonus points MUST always be included** in minute totals
- **Participation % = (students with >0 minutes) / (total students in class/grade/school)**
- **Goals Met = count of students who achieved reading goal â‰¥1 day**

### Contest Period
- **Duration:** 10 consecutive days (e.g., Oct 10-19)
- **Start date may vary** between years, but always 10 days
- **Out-of-range dates:** Cause reconciliation differences (tracked in reports Q21-Q23)

## Team Rules

### Team Color Assignment
**CRITICAL:** Team colors are determined by **alphabetical order (ascending)**, NOT by database order or team ID.

- **Team 1 (alphabetically first)** = **Blue** (`#1e3a5f`)
- **Team 2 (alphabetically second)** = **Yellow/Amber** (`#f59e0b`)

**Examples:**
- If teams are "Kitsko" and "Staub": Kitsko = Blue, Staub = Yellow
- If teams are "Phoenix" and "Dragons": Dragons = Blue, Phoenix = Yellow
- If sample DB uses "team1" and "team2": team1 = Blue, team2 = Yellow

### Team Color Consistency
- **Apply to ALL team representations:** ovals, rectangles, badges, buttons, highlights
- **Must be consistent across ALL pages:** school, teams, grade level, students, reports
- **CSS classes must follow this pattern:**
  - `.team-badge-kitsko`, `.team-badge-team1`, `.leader-badge-kitsko` â†’ Blue
  - `.team-badge-staub`, `.team-badge-team2`, `.leader-badge-staub` â†’ Yellow

## Visual Design Rules

### Winner Highlights
- **Gold ovals** = School-wide winners (best across ALL grades)
- **Silver ovals** = Grade-level/Team-level winners (best within filtered group)
- **Gold overrides silver:** If a class is both school and grade winner, show GOLD only

### Table Styling
- **Headers:** Dark blue background (`#1e3a5f`), white text, sortable with cursor:pointer
- **Rows:** Alternating white and light gray (`table-striped` in Bootstrap)
- **Hover:** Light highlight on row hover for better UX

### Page Layout Order (Card-Based Pages)
All card-based pages (School, Teams, Grade Level, Students) MUST follow this order:
1. **Filter Period dropdown** (centered, with label "ðŸ“… Filter Period:")
2. **Data Info & Sources button** (collapsible footer at bottom of page)
3. **Banner** (5 headline metrics in consistent order across pages)
4. **Middle Section Cards** (grade/team cards with top performers)
5. **Detail Table** (sortable, filterable data table)

### Banner Metric Order
**IMPORTANT:** Banner metrics must appear in the SAME ORDER across all pages, even if entity differs:

1. **Fundraising Leader** (highest $ amount)
2. **Minutes Read Leader** (highest total minutes)
3. **Sponsors Leader** (highest sponsor count)
4. **Participation Leader** (highest % participation)
5. **Goals Met Leader** (highest count of students meeting goal)

### Team Badges
- **Shape:** Rounded rectangles with padding
- **Colors:** Follow team color rules (blue for team 1, yellow for team 2)
- **Border:** Subtle border matching team color (semi-transparent)
- **Text:** Uppercase team name, contrasting color for readability

---

## State Management & Persistence

### Sticky Filters (Cross-Page)
- **Filter Period:** Persists via `sessionStorage.setItem('readathonDateFilter', value)`
- **Restored on page load:** All pages check sessionStorage and apply saved filter
- **Grade Level Filter:** Persists within grade level page only (stored in sessionStorage)

### Filter Restoration Pattern
```javascript
// On page load:
const savedFilter = sessionStorage.getItem('readathonDateFilter');
if (savedFilter) {
    document.getElementById('dateFilter').value = savedFilter;
    // Apply filter to data
}

// On filter change:
sessionStorage.setItem('readathonDateFilter', newValue);
```

## Banner Calculation Rules

### School-Wide Leaders
- **Must calculate from ALL classes** (not filtered subset)
- **Use `class_name`, NOT `teacher_name`** (handles teachers with multiple classes)
- **Must include color bonus in minutes** calculations

### Example: Handling Multi-Class Teachers
```python
# CORRECT - Group by class_name
GROUP BY ci.class_name, ci.teacher_name, ci.grade_level

# WRONG - Group by teacher_name (aggregates multiple classes)
GROUP BY ci.teacher_name, ci.grade_level
```

---

## UI Consistency Principles

### Before Implementing ANY New Feature:
1. **Check existing pages** (school.html, teams.html, grade_level.html) for similar elements
2. **Match established patterns** for tables, cards, banners, filters
3. **Use the same CSS classes** and styling for similar data representations
4. **Maintain consistent spacing, colors, fonts** with existing pages

### When Displaying Similar Data:
- If data has been displayed elsewhere (even for different entity), use the SAME visual treatment
- Example: If fundraising is shown in a green card on School page, use green card for fundraising on Students page

### General Design Principle:
**"Be consistent. Always."** - Check existing implementations before creating new ones.

## Adding New Rules

When you or the user identifies a new universal rule:
1. Add it to the appropriate section in this file
2. Include specific examples if applicable
3. Note which pages/features the rule applies to
4. Update the "Last Updated" date at the top

**If uncertain whether something is a rule, ASK THE USER.**
