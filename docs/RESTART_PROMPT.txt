Continue work on Grade Level page enhancements. Complete these tasks:

1. Add information icons (‚ìò) to Grade Level detail table headers with tooltips
   - Follow pattern from School and Teams pages
   - Include descriptions for each column metric

2. Implement tie acknowledgment logic:
   - Banner section: Show all tied winners (e.g., "üèÜ Winner: Class A, Class B (tie)")
   - Grade cards section: Show all tied classes for top performers
   - Detail table: Already working correctly (document this)

3. Update documentation:
   - Add tie handling rules to RULES.md
   - Add info icon pattern to UI_PATTERNS.md
   - Document standard approach for handling ties across all pages

4. Test thoroughly:
   - Verify info icons appear and show correct tooltips
   - Test tie scenarios with sample data
   - Check grade filter still works (K, 1st, 2nd, etc.)
