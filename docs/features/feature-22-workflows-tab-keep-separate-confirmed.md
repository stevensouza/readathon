### Feature 22: Workflows Tab - Keep Separate ✓ CONFIRMED
**Decision:** Keep Workflows as a separate tab (not merged into Reports).

**Reasoning:**
- Clear separation: "Do common task" vs "Run custom query"
- One-click execution of grouped queries
- Easier discovery of common workflows
- Can evolve to do more than just run queries

**Tab Structure (Confirmed):**
- Dashboard
- Reports (with manual query selection)
- **Workflows** (one-click grouped queries)
- **Slides** (presentation output)
- Tables
- Help

**Future Evaluation:**
- After real-world usage, evaluate if Workflows is useful
- If not used, can merge into Reports with "Quick Select" feature
- For now, implement as separate tab
