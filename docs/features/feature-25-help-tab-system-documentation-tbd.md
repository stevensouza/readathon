### Feature 25: Help Tab & System Documentation üìö TBD

**Current Status:** To be determined

**Two Open Questions:**

**A. Help Tab Content:**
- Option 1: **End-user focused manual**
  - How to upload data
  - How to run reports
  - How to create slides
  - Troubleshooting
  - FAQ
- Option 2: **Developer/technical docs**
  - System architecture
  - Database schema
  - Query explanations
  - Rebuild instructions
- Option 3: **Both** (with tabbed sections)

**B. Complete Rebuild Specification:**
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive, executable requirements doc for full system rebuild
- **Content:**
  - Database schema (all CREATE TABLE statements)
  - All queries with purpose/SQL
  - Business rules and logic
  - UI designs and layouts
  - Workflows and processes
  - Configuration details
- **Storage Location Options:**
  1. Dedicated tab in UI (e.g., "System Docs")
  2. Section within Help tab
  3. Downloadable from Help/Admin tab
  4. Accessible via query/report
- **Key Requirement:** Must be accessible to non-Claude Code users
  - Future admin may need to rebuild system
  - Should not require file system access
  - Should be viewable/downloadable from web UI

**Decision Needed:**
- Determine Help tab structure
- Determine where/how to expose rebuild documentation
- Level of detail needed in rebuild docs
- Format (Markdown? HTML? PDF?)

**Priority:** Medium (can be refined during implementation)
