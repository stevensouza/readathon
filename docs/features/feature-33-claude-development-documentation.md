## 2. Development Workflow

**Iterative Three-Phase Process:**

1. **ASCII Prototype Phase** (per global CLAUDE.md workflow)
   - Fast text-based mockups for layout and structure
   - Information architecture planning
   - Quick iteration on user feedback

2. **HTML Prototype Phase**
   - Visual refinement with full styling
   - Browser-based review and testing
   - Interactive elements (dropdowns, modals, filters)

3. **Production Code Phase**
   - Integration with Flask backend
   - Database query implementation
   - Deployment to production

**Branching Strategy:**
- All development on feature branches
- Never commit directly to master
- Merge to master only after testing and user approval

---

## 3. Sample Prompts by Development Stage

### Project Setup & Installation

```
"Create a Flask web application for managing a school read-a-thon event.
Set up the project structure, install Flask, and create a basic Hello World app."

"Set up a SQLite database with tables for student roster, daily reading logs,
and cumulative stats. Include relationships between tables."

"Create an initialization script that populates the database with 411 students
from our class roster CSV file."

"Write a requirements.txt with all Python dependencies needed for this project."
```

### Database Schema & Queries

```
"Design a database schema for tracking 411 students' daily reading minutes
over a 6-day read-a-thon (Oct 10-15, 2025). Include tables for roster,
daily logs, cumulative stats, and upload history."

"Write a SQL query to calculate total reading minutes per student,
applying a 120-minute daily cap and filtering to sanctioned dates only."

"Create a reconciliation report (Q23) that compares capped vs uncapped minutes
and explains differences by out-of-range dates and over-cap minutes."

"Add an audit trail system that logs every CSV upload with filename,
timestamp, row counts, and file type detection."
```

### CSV Parsing & Data Import

```
"Write a Python function to parse PledgeReg Daily Report CSV files.
Extract student ID, date, and minutes. Validate that minutes are numeric
and dates are in MM/DD/YYYY format."

"Implement file type detection logic: if CSV has 'Sponsors' and 'Donations'
columns, it's cumulative; if it has 'Date' and 'Minutes', it's daily."

"Add multi-file upload support: let users select multiple daily CSV files,
extract dates from filenames, and process all files in one operation."

"Create validation that rejects cumulative files uploaded to daily endpoint
and vice versa. Show clear error messages."
```

### Flask Routes & API

```
"Create a Flask route /upload that displays an upload form and handles
POST requests with CSV file uploads. Store data in SQLite."

"Build an API endpoint /api/reports/q21 that returns uncapped reading minutes
reconciliation data as JSON. Include metadata about columns and data sources."

"Implement a /dashboard/school route that displays key metrics: total students,
participation rate, total minutes, donations, and team competition results."

"Add a /workflows/qd endpoint that runs 5 reports in sequence (Q18, Q14, Q4,
Q19, Q20) for the daily slide deck update."
```

### UI/UX & Templates

```
"Create an HTML template for the School tab using Bootstrap 5.3.0.
Use cards for metrics, tables for data, and the Option J color scheme
(Navy, Teal, Gold, Coral)."

"Add collapsible sections to the report display using HTML <details> tags.
Include sections for Report Information, Column Metadata, and Analysis."

"Implement a floating 'View Analysis' button that appears on the right side
when viewing Q21, Q22, or Q23. Clicking it should open a modal dialog overlay."

"Design a responsive navigation bar with tabs for Dashboard, Reports, Workflows,
Tables, Upload, Help, and Admin. Highlight the active tab."
```

### Enhanced Features

```
"Add column tooltips to report tables. When hovering over a column header,
show a tooltip with the column's description and data source."

"Create a dynamic analysis system for Q21 that examines the data and generates
a summary, breakdown by issue type, and actionable insights."

"Implement a prototype for the enhanced report metadata feature. Include
description, last updated timestamp, collapsible sections for columns and terms,
and analysis breakdown."

"Add a Team Color Bonus metric to the School tab. Calculate bonus minutes
(10 per student) and bonus points (1 per student) based on team color
participation (data from /tmp/team_color_bonus_converted.csv)."
```

### Testing & Debugging

```
"Write a test script that verifies the audit trail system logs uploads correctly.
Test with both daily and cumulative CSV files."

"Add error handling to the CSV upload function. Catch file format errors,
missing columns, invalid data types, and provide user-friendly error messages."

"Create reconciliation reports Q21, Q22, Q23 to identify data integrity issues:
uncapped minutes, capped differences, and sanctioned vs non-sanctioned dates."

"Debug the floating analysis button: it should open a modal dialog, not scroll
to the analysis section. Reference the working prototype at
/prototypes/enhanced_report_prototype_v4.html."
```

### Documentation

```
"Create feature documentation for the Upload Audit Trail System (Feature 28).
Include requirements, implementation details, data model, and testing steps."

"Write a QUICK_START_NEXT_SESSION.md that documents the current status of
Feature 30 & 31 (Enhanced Metadata), what's completed, what's pending,
and immediate next steps."

"Generate a master index (00-INDEX.md) of all 33 features organized by category
(Upload, Reports, UI/UX, Database, etc.) with status and priority."

"Add a CLAUDE.md file with project instructions for future Claude Code sessions.
Include architecture overview, development commands, key design decisions,
and file structure."
```

## 4. Key Prompting Techniques Used

### Be Specific About Requirements
❌ "Make the upload page better"
✅ "Redesign the upload page to use the Option J color scheme, add progress indicators,
   and show upload history with timestamps"

### Provide Context & Constraints
```
"This is a local-only Flask app (no server deployment). All data is stored
in SQLite. The app must work offline after initial setup. Use Bootstrap CDN
for styling, no npm or webpack."
```

### Reference Existing Code/Files
```
"Update the School tab (templates/school.html) to match the design from
/prototypes/dashboard_school_tab_v2.html. Use the same card layout,
color scheme, and metric organization."
```

### Ask for Prototypes First
```
"Create an ASCII prototype showing the layout for the Grades tab. Include
sections for grade summary table, competition metrics, and expandable
grade details. Let's review the structure before implementing HTML."
```

### Request Step-by-Step Plans
```
"I want to add a floating analysis button to Q21, Q22, Q23 reports.
Can you create a plan for implementing this? Include:
1) CSS for the button, 2) JavaScript for modal behavior,
3) Integration points in existing templates."
```

### Iterate with Feedback
```
"The analysis button scrolls to the section instead of opening a modal.
The prototype at /prototypes/enhanced_report_prototype_v4.html has the
correct behavior. Can you update reports.html and admin.html to match
the prototype's modal implementation?"
```

## 5. Lessons Learned

**What Worked Well:**
- ASCII → HTML → Production workflow for UI features
- Feature-branch development (never commit to master)
- Comprehensive documentation in docs/features/
- Prototyping before production implementation
- Iterative refinement with user feedback

**What Could Be Improved:**
- Earlier creation of comprehensive test suite
- More detailed API documentation
- Performance testing with larger datasets
- Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

**Best Practices:**
- Keep prompts specific and context-rich
- Break large features into smaller, testable pieces
- Maintain a QUICK_START_NEXT_SESSION.md for continuity
- Use prototypes to validate design before coding
- Document decisions in feature files as you go
