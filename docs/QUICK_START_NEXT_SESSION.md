## ✅ RECENTLY COMPLETED (2025-10-29)

### Bug Fixes - Grade Level Page
All four critical bugs have been fixed:

1. **Goals Met Banner Calculation** (queries.py:1598-1601)
   - **Problem:** Showed count "22" instead of percentage "95.2%"
   - **Fix:** Changed to calculate percentage with CASE statement
   ```python
   CASE WHEN ci.total_students > 0
       THEN ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT dl.student_name) * 100.0 / ci.total_students, 1)
       ELSE 0
   END as value
   ```

2. **SQL Syntax Error on Grade Filter** (app.py:1271, queries.py:1175, 1188)
   - **Problem:** Double WHERE clause when filtering by grade (e.g., "WHERE ci.grade_level = 'K'")
   - **Fix:** Changed grade_where to use " AND" instead of "WHERE", added "WHERE 1=1" anchors
   ```python
   # app.py:1271
   grade_where = f" AND ci.grade_level = '{grade_filter}'"

   # queries.py:1175, 1188
   WHERE 1=1{grade_where}
   ```

3. **Student Count Showing School-Wide Total** (queries.py:1352)
   - **Problem:** Showed 1497 (school total) instead of 67 (grade total)
   - **Root cause:** JOIN multiplication with SUM(ci.total_students)
   - **Fix:** Changed to COUNT(DISTINCT r.student_name)
   ```python
   COUNT(DISTINCT r.student_name) as num_students,
   ```

4. **Team Split Calculation**
   - **Problem:** Showed 0 for both Kitsko and Staub teams
   - **Fix:** Fixed as part of the student count fix above

**Testing:** User confirmed "ok it looks good" after fixes.

## 🚀 PENDING TASKS

### Task 1: Add Information Icons to Table Headers

**Requirement:** Add ⓘ icons to each column header in the Grade Level detail table with tooltips explaining the metric.

**Reference Implementation:**
- School page: `/templates/school.html`
- Teams page: `/templates/teams.html`

**Pattern to Follow:**
```html
<th onclick="sortTable(3)" style="cursor:pointer;"
    title="Total fundraising dollars raised by this class">
    Fundraising ⓘ ▲
</th>
```

**Columns Needing Icons:**
- Class Name - "Teacher or homeroom class name"
- Grade - "Grade level (K-5th)"
- Team - "Team assignment (Kitsko or Staub)"
- Fundraising - "Total fundraising dollars raised by this class"
- Minutes Read - "Total reading minutes logged by students in this class (capped at 120 min/day)"
- Sponsors - "Total number of sponsors for students in this class"
- Participation % - "Percentage of students who logged reading time during the period"
- Goals Met ≥1 Day - "Percentage of students who met their daily reading goal at least once"

**File to Edit:** `/templates/grade_level.html` (detail table section)

---

### Task 2: Implement Tie Acknowledgment Logic

**Requirement:** When multiple classes tie for a metric, acknowledge ALL tied winners (not just the first one).

#### 2a. Banner Section Ties

**Current Behavior:** Only shows first winner
```
🏆 Winner: 5th Grade • ogg
```

**Required Behavior:** Show all tied winners
```
🏆 Winners (tie): 5th Grade • ogg, 4th Grade • rivera
```

**Implementation Location:** `/app.py` - `grade_level` route (around line 1260-1340)
**SQL to Modify:** `get_school_wide_leaders_query` in `/queries.py`

**Logic:**
1. For each metric, find the maximum value
2. Select ALL classes that have that maximum value
3. If count > 1, display "(tie)" indicator
4. Format as comma-separated list

#### 2b. Grade Cards Section Ties

**Current Behavior:** Shows single top performer per card
**Required Behavior:** Show all tied performers

**Implementation Location:** Same as banner section (banner_data is used for cards)

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Single winner -->
<div class="grade-stat-number">
    <span class="team-badge team-badge-kitsko">KITSKO</span>
    <span class="ms-2">5th Grade • ogg</span>
</div>

<!-- Tied winners -->
<div class="grade-stat-number">
    <span class="team-badge team-badge-kitsko">KITSKO</span>
    <span class="ms-2">5th Grade • ogg</span>
</div>
<div class="grade-stat-number-tie">
    <span class="team-badge team-badge-staub">STAUB</span>
    <span class="ms-2">4th Grade • rivera</span>
</div>
```

#### 2c. Detail Table Ties (Document Only)

**Current Behavior:** Sorting already groups tied values together naturally.

**Action Required:** Add comment to code documenting this behavior:
```python
# Note: Detail table handles ties correctly through natural sorting.
# When multiple classes have the same value, they appear consecutively
# in the sorted output. No special tie-handling logic required.
```

---

### Task 3: Update Documentation

#### 3a. Add Tie Handling Rules to RULES.md

**File:** `/RULES.md`
**Section to Add:** After "Banner Calculation Rules" (around line 129)

```markdown
## Tie Handling Rules

### When Ties Occur
- **Definition:** A tie occurs when 2+ entities (classes, grades, teams) have the exact same value for a metric
- **Applies to:** Banner metrics, card leaders, table winners (gold/silver ovals)

### Tie Display Rules
1. **Banner Section:** Show all tied winners with "(tie)" indicator
   - Format: "🏆 Winners (tie): Entity A, Entity B, Entity C"
   - Example: "🏆 Winners (tie): 5th Grade • ogg, 4th Grade • rivera"

2. **Card Section:** Display all tied performers
   - Show each tied entity on separate line or in stacked format
   - Maintain team color badges for clarity

3. **Detail Table:** Natural sorting groups ties together
   - No special indicator needed
   - Sorted output naturally shows all tied values consecutively

4. **Gold/Silver Ovals:** Apply to ALL tied winners
   - If 3 classes tie for school winner → all 3 get gold ovals
   - If 2 classes tie for grade winner → both get silver ovals
   - Gold still overrides silver (school-wide ties trump grade-level ties)

### Implementation Pattern
```python
# Find maximum value
max_value = max(row['value'] for row in results)

# Get all entities with that value
tied_winners = [row for row in results if row['value'] == max_value]

# Check for tie
is_tie = len(tied_winners) > 1

# Format output
if is_tie:
    winner_text = f"Winners (tie): {', '.join(w['name'] for w in tied_winners)}"
else:
    winner_text = f"Winner: {tied_winners[0]['name']}"
```

### Consistency Requirement
- Tie handling MUST be consistent across all pages (School, Teams, Grade Level, Students)
- Any changes to tie logic must be applied to all pages
```

#### 3b. Add Info Icon Pattern to UI_PATTERNS.md

**File:** `/UI_PATTERNS.md`
**Section to Add:** After "Sortable Tables" section (around line 360)

```markdown
### 5. Information Icons (Tooltips)

**Purpose:** Provide inline help for column headers and complex metrics

**HTML Pattern:**
```html
<th onclick="sortTable(3)" style="cursor:pointer;"
    title="Detailed description of this metric">
    Column Name ⓘ ▲
</th>
```

**CSS (Already in base.html):**
```css
/* Tooltips automatically styled by browser */
[title] {
    cursor: help;
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use ⓘ character (Unicode U+24D8) for consistency
- Place icon AFTER column name, BEFORE sort arrow (▲/▼)
- Keep tooltip text concise (1-2 sentences max)
- Explain what the metric measures and where data comes from
- Use consistent terminology across all tooltips

**Standard Tooltip Texts:**
- **Class Name:** "Teacher or homeroom class name"
- **Grade:** "Grade level (K-5th)"
- **Team:** "Team assignment for competition"
- **Fundraising:** "Total fundraising dollars raised (from Reader_Cumulative table)"
- **Minutes Read:** "Total reading minutes logged (capped at 120 min/day, includes color bonus)"
- **Sponsors:** "Total number of unique sponsors (from Reader_Cumulative table)"
- **Participation %:** "Percentage of students who logged reading time during the period"
- **Goals Met:** "Percentage of students who met their daily reading goal at least once"

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Add ⓘ to all table column headers
- [ ] Verify tooltips appear on hover
- [ ] Test on mobile (long press should show tooltip)
- [ ] Ensure tooltip doesn't interfere with sorting
- [ ] Maintain consistency across all pages
```

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### Step 1: Add Info Icons (15-20 minutes)

1. Open `/templates/grade_level.html`
2. Find the detail table `<thead>` section
3. Add ⓘ icon and `title` attribute to each `<th>`
4. Test in browser - hover over headers to verify tooltips

### Step 2: Implement Tie Logic (45-60 minutes)

1. **Analyze current queries** in `/queries.py`:
   - `get_school_wide_leaders_query` (lines 1550-1650)
   - Identify how winners are selected (currently uses LIMIT 1 or similar)

2. **Modify SQL to return ALL tied winners:**
   ```python
   # Instead of LIMIT 1, use:
   WITH MaxValues AS (
       SELECT metric_name, MAX(value) as max_value
       FROM ... GROUP BY metric_name
   )
   SELECT ...
   WHERE value = (SELECT max_value FROM MaxValues WHERE metric_name = ...)
   ```

3. **Update Flask route** in `/app.py`:
   - Modify banner_data structure to support multiple winners per metric
   - Add `is_tie` flag and `winners` list

4. **Update Jinja2 template** in `/templates/grade_level.html`:
   - Check for multiple winners
   - Format display with "(tie)" indicator
   - Show all winners in comma-separated or stacked format

5. **Test with production data:**
   - Find metrics with actual ties
   - Verify display is correct
   - Test edge cases (2-way tie, 3-way tie, no tie)

### Step 3: Update Documentation (20-30 minutes)

1. Add tie handling rules to `/RULES.md`
2. Add info icon pattern to `/UI_PATTERNS.md`
3. Verify formatting is consistent with existing sections
4. Update "Last Updated" dates in both files

### Step 4: Test Everything (30 minutes)

1. **Restart Flask:** `python3 app.py --db prod`
2. **Test info icons:**
   - Visit Grade Level page
   - Hover over each column header
   - Verify tooltips appear with correct text
3. **Test tie logic:**
   - Check banner for ties
   - Check grade cards for ties
   - Verify gold/silver ovals applied to all tied winners
4. **Test grade filter:**
   - Select K, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, All Grades
   - Verify no SQL errors
   - Verify student counts are correct
5. **Test on mobile:**
   - Responsive design still works
   - Tooltips accessible (long press)
