---

## 🔴 Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### 1. School Page Banner Section (help.html lines 90-167)
**Current State:** Describes 5 separate colored boxes (Green, Blue, Orange, Purple, Red)
**Actual State:** Single dark blue banner with 6 metrics in a horizontal row

**Actual Banner Metrics (school.html lines 441-473):**
1. 📅 Campaign Day - Current day of total days + date
2. 💰 Fundraising - Total $ + student count + percentage
3. 📚 Minutes Read - Hours + minutes (with 120/day cap) + ◐ icon when filtered
4. 🎁 Sponsors - Count + student count + percentage
5. 👥 Avg. Participation (With Color) - Percentage + student count + ◐ icon when filtered
6. 🎯 Goal Met (≥1 Day) - Percentage + student count + ◐ icon when filtered

**Action Required:**
- Replace entire "Dashboard Verification Boxes" section with accurate "School Page Headline Banner" section
- Document the ◐ filter indicator that appears on certain metrics when date-filtered
- Remove references to colored boxes
- Add information about the date filter dropdown

### 2. Reports & Data Section (help.html - section needs review)
**Issues to verify:**
- Report list may be outdated
- Report types and descriptions need verification against current state
- Enhanced metadata features (column descriptions, terms, analysis) should be documented

**Action Required:**
- Review actual Reports & Data page structure (3 accordion sections)
- Update report list to match current 22 reports
- Document metadata features (Column Descriptions, Data Sources, Key Terms, Automated Analysis)
- Document table views and workflows sections

### 3. Admin Section (help.html - section needs review)
**Current State:** May describe old structure
**Actual State:** 5 tabs in Admin page

**Actual Admin Tabs:**
1. **Actions** - Selective table clearing, upload history, database integrity
2. **Data Management** - View tables, export CSV, table statistics
3. **Database Creation** - Create new read-a-thon databases for future years
4. **Database Registry** - Manage all databases across years (switch active, view metadata)
5. **Database Comparison** - Year-over-year analysis with 50 metrics

**Action Required:**
- Update Admin section to accurately describe all 5 tabs
- Document Database Registry functionality (v2026.11.0)
- Document Database Comparison feature (v2026.12.0) with 50 metrics
- Document only ONE database is active at a time

### 4. Workflows Section (help.html - needs verification)
**Current Workflows:**
- **QD: Daily Slide Update** - Runs 5 daily reports (Slides 2-6)
- **QC: Cumulative Workflow** - Runs 6 cumulative reports (Q5, Q6, Q14, Q18, Q19, Q20)

**Action Required:**
- Verify workflow names and report lists match current state
- Document purpose of each workflow
- Add any new workflows that may have been added

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

### 5. Broken IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md Link (help/requirements page)
**Issue:** Page tries to read `IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md` but file doesn't exist
**Error:** "IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md not found"

**Action Required:**
- Either create the file with comprehensive build instructions OR
- Update the route to read from `md/IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md` if it exists there OR
- Remove this help page if not needed

**Context:** This was intended to be a comprehensive prompt that could be used to rebuild the application from scratch, including:
- All features and tabs (School, Teams, Grade, Students, Upload, Reports, Admin)
- Database schema and queries
- Styling and UI patterns
- Interactive features (sorting, filtering, etc.)
- Testing requirements

### 6. Add Table of Contents to All Help Pages
**Pages needing TOC:**
- `/help` - User Manual (816 lines, very long - TOC essential)
- `/help/installation` - Installation Guide (TOC would be helpful)
- `/help/claude` - Claude Code documentation (needs review and expansion)
- `/help/requirements` - Application requirements (currently has broken link)

**TOC Implementation Options:**
- **Option A:** Sticky sidebar TOC (like modern documentation sites)
- **Option B:** Top-of-page jump links with "Back to Top" buttons
- **Option C:** Bootstrap scrollspy navigation

**Recommended:** Option A (sticky sidebar) for best UX

### 7. Upload Page Documentation
**Action Required:**
- Document the two-file upload process (daily logs + cumulative stats)
- Document CSV format requirements
- Document date selection
- Document upload history/audit trail
- Link to ReadAThon.com for where to get files

---

## 🟢 Low Priority / Enhancements

### 8. Students Page Documentation
**Recently Added:** Students tab with master-detail view
**Documentation Status:** Partially covered in Quick Start

**Action Required:**
- Add dedicated section for Students page
- Document master table with search functionality
- Document detail view (if implemented)
- Document search capabilities (searches all columns)

### 9. Help Page Cross-References
**Enhancement:** Add internal links between help sections

Examples:
- Link from ReadAThon.com section to Upload section
- Link from Reports section to Workflows section
- Link from School Page section to date filtering

### 10. Screenshots/Visual Aids
**Enhancement:** Consider adding screenshots to help pages

**Candidates for screenshots:**
- School page banner showing 6 metrics
- Database Registry interface
- Database Comparison side-by-side view
- Report metadata modal (Analysis button)
- Workflow execution results

```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Remove these standalone sections:**
   - School Page Headline Banner (lines ~157-277) - KEEP CONTENT, MOVE TO INTERFACE
   - Uploading Daily Data (lines ~338-397) - MOVE TO INTERFACE > Upload Tab
   - Reports & Data Page (lines ~401-671) - MOVE TO INTERFACE > Reports Tab
   - Workflows (lines ~672-720) - MOVE TO INTERFACE > Workflows Tab

2. **Replace "Dashboard Tabs" section (lines ~723-773) with comprehensive "Interface" section**

3. **Update TOC** (lines 52-65):
   ```html
   <a href="#interface" class="toc-link"><strong>Interface</strong></a>
   <a href="#school-tab" class="toc-link" style="padding-left: 2rem;">School Tab</a>
   <a href="#teams-tab" class="toc-link" style="padding-left: 2rem;">Teams Tab</a>
   <a href="#grade-tab" class="toc-link" style="padding-left: 2rem;">Grade Level Tab</a>
   <a href="#students-tab" class="toc-link" style="padding-left: 2rem;">Students Tab</a>
   <a href="#upload-tab" class="toc-link" style="padding-left: 2rem;">Upload Tab</a>
   <a href="#reports-tab" class="toc-link" style="padding-left: 2rem;">Reports & Data Tab</a>
   <a href="#workflows-tab" class="toc-link" style="padding-left: 2rem;">Workflows Tab</a>
   <a href="#admin-tab" class="toc-link" style="padding-left: 2rem;">Admin Tab</a>
   <a href="#help-tab" class="toc-link" style="padding-left: 2rem;">Help Tab</a>
   ```

4. **Content Guidelines:**
   - **School Tab:** Condense banner details to 1-2 paragraphs + bulleted list of 6 metrics
   - **Teams/Grade/Students:** Keep existing Dashboard Tabs content, expand slightly
   - **Upload:** Move existing Upload section content, keep current detail level
   - **Reports:** Summarize 3 accordion sections, mention 22 reports + metadata features
   - **Workflows:** Move existing Workflows content, keep current detail level
   - **Admin:** NEW - document all 5 tabs with 2-3 bullet points each
   - **Help:** NEW - brief overview of 4 help pages with links

5. **Styling:**
   - Use `<h5>` for each tab subsection
   - Keep current card styling (`border-info`, `border-primary`, etc.)
   - Maintain consistency with existing help.html patterns

**Estimated Scope:**
- Lines to remove: ~400 (4 standalone sections)
- Lines to add: ~500 (comprehensive Interface section)
- Net change: +100 lines (from 967 to ~1,067 lines)
- Number of edits: ~6 major Edit operations

### Phase 3: Polish & Enhancements
- [ ] Add cross-references between sections
- [ ] Consider adding screenshots
- [ ] Review all help pages for consistency

### Help Page Documentation Phase 2 (NEXT SESSION)
**Status:** Documented and ready to implement
**File:** DOCUMENTATION_UPDATES_NEEDED.md (this file)
**See:** Phase 2 section above for complete implementation plan

**User Request (from Session 3):**
> "Maybe we get rid of that [standalone School banner section] and instead stick to the dashboards section but enhance that some and put subheaders for each tab and include the other tabs like help and admin as well as students, grade etc. You could also add uploads and have info on workflows and reports data. They should all be indented in the TOC under a section called Interface"

**Implementation Approach:** Consolidate all 9 tabs under one comprehensive "Interface" section with nested TOC structure

### Context Loss Prevention
This file is automatically updated after each session to preserve:
- What was completed (with commit hashes)
- What needs to be done next (detailed plans)
- User preferences and decisions
- Implementation details for complex changes

This ensures continuity across sessions even after conversation compaction.

## 🎯 Quick Start for Next Documentation Session

### Phase 2: Interface Reorganization

**What to do:**
1. Read Phase 2 plan in this file (lines 160-260)
2. Start Flask: `python3 app.py --db sample`
3. Open help.html for editing
4. Follow Implementation Steps 1-5 in Phase 2 section
5. Test in browser: http://127.0.0.1:5001/help
6. Commit when complete

**Key Files:**
- `templates/help.html` - Main file to edit (967 lines currently)
- `DOCUMENTATION_UPDATES_NEEDED.md` - This file (complete plan documented)

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours for full Interface reorganization

**Strategy:**
- Work incrementally: Remove one section, add corresponding Interface subsection, test
- Use Edit tool for each major section (6 edits total)
- Test frequently in browser to catch broken links or formatting issues
- All tests should still pass (no Python code changes, only HTML)
