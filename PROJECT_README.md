# Read-a-Thon System Development

## ðŸ“‹ IMPORTANT: Before Starting Any Work
1. **READ** `/IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md` - This is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for all requirements
2. Check which features are marked as completed (âœ“) vs. pending
3. Confirm requirements with user before implementing
4. Update IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md if requirements change during work

## When Compacting Conversations
- IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md must be preserved
- Reference it in summary: "See IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md for complete requirements"
- Include link to this file in summary

## Session Startup Protocol
1. Read IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md
2. Ask user: "Is IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md up to date, or have requirements changed?"
3. Confirm which feature to work on
4. Proceed with implementation
