"""
Data Accuracy Test Suite - Read-a-Thon Application

This test suite validates that calculations, rankings, and winner determinations
are mathematically correct by comparing displayed values against database queries.

Unlike structural tests (test_*_page.py), these tests verify:
- Correct winner identification (reading leaders, fundraising leaders, top classes)
- Accurate calculations (totals, averages, gaps, percentages)
- Proper ranking/ordering (top performers, leaderboards)
- Data integrity across filters (date filters, grade filters)

Sample Data Contract:
The tests query readathon_sample.db to determine expected values dynamically.
This makes tests resilient to sample data changes while still catching calculation bugs.

Database Schema (sample database):
- Roster: student_name (PK), class_name, teacher_name, grade_level, team_name
- Reader_Cumulative: student_name (PK/FK), donation_amount, sponsors, cumulative_minutes
- Class_Info: class_name (PK), teacher_name, grade_level, team_name, total_students

Test Organization:
- Phase 1: Critical winners and totals (9 tests)
- Phase 2: Rankings, edge cases, and filter accuracy (12 tests)
